Graphene Engine
===============

Graphene is licensed under the MIT license. You are free to use it in any
project, commercial or otherwise.

Graphene relies on Carbon (<https://github.com/sparky-game/carbon>) for
low-level and all backend functionality, which is licensed under
AGPL-3.0-only, with also the possibility to purchase a commercial
license.
Thus, while Graphene itself is permissive, linking against Carbon will
govern the licensing requirements of your final executable. Please,
ensure you comply with Carbon's licensing terms.
